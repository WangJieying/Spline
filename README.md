# Spline

This library fits skeletons with B-spline curves and obtains control points.

If you want to install this library in your Conan system, you can run:

$ conan create . Spline/0.0.1@jieyingwang/dmd

Note that all files inside 'Graphics' and 'Mathematics' directories are deleted in this repository since they are really huge. But you can totally download them from [here](https://github.com/WangJieying/GeometricTools-5.8-library)
